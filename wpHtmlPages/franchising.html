        <h2>A TRUE LEGACY BRAND FRANCHISE OPPORTUNITY</h2>

        <p>There are many restaurant brands out there presenting franchise opportunities … but there are few brands with proven brand lovers.  <strong>Texadelphia is a true Texas one-of-a-kind brand with built in demand, awareness and affection.</strong> </p>
        <p>Texadelphia works collaboratively in a franchise-centric organization with great support systems in place. Our Texadelphia franchise partners enjoy many advantages, including low start-up costs, superb ground up or conversion construction design, strong branding and social media programs, and the best quality menu in the business.</p>

        <h2>FRANCHISING OVERVIEW</h2>
        <p>We offer franchises to qualified applicants for the establishment and operation of Texadelphia restaurants. Each restaurant offers quick service specialty sandwiches and other related food products, including signature cheesesteak sandwiches, which are retailed through our distinctively styled trade dress and design (each a “Texadelphia Restaurant”). Each Texadelphia Restaurant operates in accordance with our proprietary business format and system (“Texadelphia System”).</p>
