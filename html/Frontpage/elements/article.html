        <h2>The Original Texas Cheesesteak Est 1981</h2>
        <h3>The Texadelphia Story</h3>
        <p>Texadelphia is the home of the "Original Texas Cheesesteak." It's what we've been doing since 1981. When our
            founder moved to Austin from Pennsylvania in 1980, he brought with him a desire to create and serve great
            food in a place where everyone is treated like family. He brought with him his great love for Philly's
            favorite sandwich, but served it with a Texas twist. Texadelphia first opened in 1981 in Austin, Texas.
            After a few years, Texadelphia restaurants began popping up all across Texas and even Oklahoma.</p>
        <h3>The Texadelphia Difference</h3>
        <p>We start with the highest quality, fresh ingredients. We make each and every cheesesteak to order and top it
            with a signature sauce of your choice. All of our cheesesteaks, burgers, salads and deli-sandwiches are
            served with complementary tortilla chips and fresh salsa. It's how our founder did it, it's how we do it.
            It's our passion. Texadelphia. Inspired By Philly ...Perfected in Texas!</p>
